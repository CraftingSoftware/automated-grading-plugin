## What is the point of this?

This guide should help you get started as a developer for this plugin. It will help you understand the purpose of the plugin, clarify the reasoning behind the design choices, and more. Some details about the project will inevidibly be missed here, so this should be a **living document**. Always feel free to update it with the implementation changes and when you have any ideas pertaining to the project.

## Why this plugin?

The purpose of this plugin is to create an infastructure to automate:

1. Converting a sample Google Sheet into multiple markdown files defined by regions containing individual student grades.
2. Pushing those markdown files into individual students' gradebook repositories.

This may seem broad, but that's the point. In order to make this plugin able to be used by any professor using GitHub, we need to allow any problem to be solved in any way. To do this, we allow the user to define their own configuration for the plugin.
