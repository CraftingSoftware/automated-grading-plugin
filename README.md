# Automated Grading Plugin for SheetShuttle

## Description

TODO: Add a little bit about the challenges we faced during this project.
TODO: Add a sentence or two describing the features we wish to implement in the future (if any).

This plugin utilizes the tools provided by SheetShuttle to automatically push
grades obtained from a Google Sheet to each individual student's gradebook
GitHub repository. We decided to use Python to program this plugin as it
provides the framework for GitHub interaction and other dependencies with PyPI.
